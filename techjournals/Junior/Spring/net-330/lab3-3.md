# Lab 3-3 DHCP in Packet Tracer

1. Creating pools in a router/magic switch is very painful but the UI makes it fine
2. Assigning helper address to a real interface or a vlan interface is fairly easy {except that you must remember to do it} (see the labeled section in my iOS cheatsheet)
3. The main issue I encountered was that I typo'd one of the VLAN ids. Oops!
