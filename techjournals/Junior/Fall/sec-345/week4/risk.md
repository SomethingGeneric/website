# Risk Analysis/Management

## Risk Management Framework

The RMF is a standardized process to ensure relevant assets are being protected, monitored, and changes to how these steps are happening are performed in a timely and organized manner.

### NIST RMF
1. Prepare - Establish context and priorities
2. Categorize - ... the relevant information system(s), and information processed
3. Select - ... the initial set of baseline controls for the information system(s)
4. Implement - ... the controls identified in the previous setp
5. Asses - A third party asses the controls and verifies that they are properly applied to the system(s)
6. Authorize - The system(s) is granted or denied an `Authorization to Operate` (ATO)
7. Monitor - ... the system(s) continously to ensure compliance

## Risk Analysis Strategies/Types
* Qualitative - more situation and scenario based, rather than simply math
* Quantitative - assign dollar figures to assets
