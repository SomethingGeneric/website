# Some thoughts on static(ish) sites
I've always hated web-design. In fact, I actually paid a friend of mine, [Kris](https://github.com/kketg), to do the CSS and templates for my previous site.

My personal website, anyways, is just a place for information, and thus, the format doesn't matter.

Jekyll is lovely since I can just write stuff, in markdown, and magically get a new page that matches the rest of the site.

I might actually be able to take down notes in a way where I can reference them later, which is lovely

## Plus, markdown is shorthand for HTML tags
