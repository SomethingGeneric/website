title:  “Moving this site to Docusaurus”
authors: [matt]

<h1 id="jekyll-was-great">Jekyll was great.</h1>
<p>It was. But, I think that in the long run, Docusaurus will be better.</p>
<p>For starters, being able to use <code>.mdx</code> rather than normal markdown is, frankly, awesome.</p>
<p>Also, it’s waaaay more friendly to the idea of just,,, tossing markdown files in a folder, running a script, and calling it a day.</p>
<p>I know I said this when I moved to Jekyll, but hopefully this time, I actually mean it when I say I’ll write more stuff on here.</p>
<p>Also, I’m going to probably move all the stuff from my gitbook on to here, and have a much better system for class notes.</p>  </body></html>
