<p>I’ve always hated web-design. In fact, I actually paid a friend of mine, <a href="https://github.com/kketg">Kris</a>, to do the CSS and templates for my previous site.</p>
<p>My personal website, anyways, is just a place for information, and thus, the format doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Jekyll is lovely since I can just write stuff, in markdown, and magically get a new page that matches the rest of the site.</p>
<p>I might actually be able to take down notes in a way where I can reference them later, which is lovely</p>
