<ul>
<li>The Ethernet header is 14 bytes.</li>
<li>It looks like the very very first 6 bytes are the destination MAC address.</li>
<li>The IPv4 header is 20 bytes.</li>
<li>The ethernet header is the first one we see because it’s the most fundamental part of moving a packet between devices.</li>
<li>Packet capture file is: <a href="/tcipg.pcapng">tcipg</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="second-pcap">Second PCAP</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ethernet header is 32 bytes</li>
<li>The padding is 18 bytes</li>
<li>The padding is included because the response ARP payload is so short that the entire packet would be too small otherwise. (Source: “… which means an additional 18 bytes of padding had to be added to ensure this frame reaches the minimum acceptable length of 64 bytes.” from: <a href="https://www.practicalnetworking.net/series/arp/traditional-arp/">https://www.practicalnetworking.net/series/arp/traditional-arp/</a>)</li>
<li>Packet capture file is <a href="/switch_ping.pcapng">switch_ping</a></li>
