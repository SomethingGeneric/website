<p>Changing <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Utilman.exe</code> and/or <code>C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe</code> for <code>cmd.exe</code> is a super easy way to get in to a Windows box, assuming you have a USB key of Kali or some other distro.</p>
<p>The only trouble that I encountered with this lab was that the VM spun up Windows once before I changed the boot option, so it was marked as hibernated when I tried to <code>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/foo</code> in Kali. To fix this, I found <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/163806/force-mount-windows-hibernated-partition-in-read-write-mode">this post</a> which suggested <code>ntfsfix /dev/sda2</code>, which worked flawlessly for me!</p>  </body></html>
