<p>I don’t know too much what to write here.</p>
<p>My main takeaway was to <strong>not</strong> use the default iOS config for an 1841 router, because apparently it was quite silly. (did not allow cross-talk between ports on different subnets ???)</p>
<p>Configuring IP addresses on ports is something we’ve covered before, and is documented in the Cisco iOS cheatsheet at the top level of the techjournals category.</p>
<p>Configuring IP addresses on client devices is covered by many of the Linux classes, and <code>nmtui</code> as we used in this lab is on my CentOS cheatsheet.</p>  </body></html>
