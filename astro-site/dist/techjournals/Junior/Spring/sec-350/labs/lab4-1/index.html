<h2 id="wheres-the-notes">Where’s the notes?</h2>
<p>Most of my documentation for this lab involved editing/expanding the VyOS reference sheet, specifically the sections “Setting up zone policy” and “RIP”</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-issues">Troubleshooting issues</h2>
<p>The main issue I had in this particular lab was that I accidentally disabled new connections outbound from <code>fw01</code> by setting <code>state established enable</code> in rule 1 of <code>LAN-to-WAN</code> firewall, rather than simply <code>rule 1 accept</code>.
As stated in my VyOS reference page, I tested to see if that firewall was the problem by <code>set firewall name LAN-to-WAN default-action accept ; commit ; save</code>, and when my pings started working again, I ran <code>show firewall name LAN-to-WAN</code>, and noticed my mistake. Oopsies!</p>
<h2 id="exporting-vyos-config">Exporting VyOS Config</h2>
<p>I created a Git repository: <a href="https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/sec350">https://github.com/SomethingGeneric/sec350</a>
Installing git on VyOS was a bit of an adventure.</p>
<p>The tl;dr is that you need to create a file like: <code>sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sec350.list</code>
And input:</p>
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib non-free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Then you can run <code>sudo apt update</code> (DO NOT RUN <code>apt upgrade</code> !!! The internet says it will break VyOS (thankfully I read that and did not try it myself))</p>
<p>Finally, you can now run <code>sudo apt install -y git</code></p>
<p>And then git should work as normal, only without bash tab-completion like you’d be used to on a more “normal” linux machine.</p>  </body></html>
