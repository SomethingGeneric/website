<ul>
<li>Processors are the calculator, and coordinator of a PC</li>
<li>Clock cycles measured in hertz (per second)</li>
<li>Modern CPU’s run at speeds nearing 5GHz, or ~5 billion cycles per second</li>
<li>Different levels of cache (short-term memory for the CPU) are used depending on the amount of time between reads for a given bit of information</li>
<li>L1 cache is the closest to the CPU, thus the fastest. L2 and L3, respectively, can hold more information but are slower for the CPU to access</li>
<li>Clock cycles are sine waves generated by the motherboard. Modern CPU’s receive data at four points during the clock cycle.</li>
<li>GPU’s are similar to CPU’s but typically used only for math related to the display output of a device. Some CPU’s have integrated GPU’s so that the end user does not need a separate card.</li>
<li>There are many different approaches to cooling a CPU, the most common of which is fans. Some PC’s will also make use of thermal pads or water cooling.</li>
<li>The chipset is a complement to the CPU, and works with the CPU to manage access to peripherals, RAM, and other components.</li>
