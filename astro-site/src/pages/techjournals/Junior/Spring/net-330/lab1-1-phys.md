# Lab 1.1 Physical Hardware

I don't know too much what to write here.

My main takeaway was to **not** use the default iOS config for an 1841 router, because apparently it was quite silly. (did not allow cross-talk between ports on different subnets ???)

Configuring IP addresses on ports is something we've covered before, and is documented in the Cisco iOS cheatsheet at the top level of the techjournals category.

Configuring IP addresses on client devices is covered by many of the Linux classes, and `nmtui` as we used in this lab is on my CentOS cheatsheet.
