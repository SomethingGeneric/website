# Bias in Cybersecurity

## Cognitive vs Motivational
Cognitive is unconcious factors that can affect your beliefs.

Motivational bias is a "filter" that changes what you say versus what you actually believe.

## Sub-types

### Nonverbal bias
Ignoring your own concerns to go with the larger group.

### Affinity bias
Bias towards or against someone because of some affiliation, eg. same school, same team.

### Halo/horns
When one attribute of a person takes presidence over others in either a positive or negative manner.

### Similarity bias
We prefer to surround ourselves with people like us.

### Contrast Effect
Comparing to what/who came before.

### Attribution bias
We tend to attribute our failures to other people who were part of a task, rather than ourselves.

When it comes to other people, this is typically reversed.

### Confirmation bias
Looking for reasons to confirm or deny your own suspicions, even if they are already unfounded.

### Conformity bias
Evaluation based on body language, appearence, style of dress, etc.
