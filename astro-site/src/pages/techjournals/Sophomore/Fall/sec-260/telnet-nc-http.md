### Netcat had me really stumped
So here's some stuff I looked at to figure out why `OPTIONS` wasn't `OPTION`-ing:
* [Security StackExchange Post](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/70561/how-to-identify-the-http-methods-supported-by-a-web-server)
* [MDN page on HTTP messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)
* [MDN page on HTTP OPTIONS specifically](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS)


## Part 3: curl
* Command: `curl http://localhost:8008`
