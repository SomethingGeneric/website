# Computer Memory

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

* Stores currently running code/OS and relevant data
* Volatile memory, meaning contents are lost if system is shutdown
* Most RAM is on/connected to the motherboard
  * However, some SRAM (also called cache) is within the processor package.
* Accessing information from a hard drive is (approx) 1mil times slower than from RAM.

## ROM (Read-Only memory)

* Found on adapters and accessory devices
* Not cleared on shutdown

## Module Types

* SDRAM: Fast burst address
* DDR: Double data rate
* DDR(2-4L)

## Memory features

* `parity`: doubling to check for accurady
* `ECC`: error correcting code - automaticalyl fixes up to 4-bit memory errors

## Disk caching (swap)

* Swap partition: address space that's raw block area on the harddrive
* Swap file: pre-allocated file within an existing disk partition
* Swap spaces are part of the overall address space, and share it with all normal RAM

## Monitoring Memory

In task manager, click "more details", then click on "memory."

## Flash Memory

... is a storage medium using solid-state non-volative chips. Used in mobile devices, portable devices like thumb drives & sd cards
