# Packet Tracer Notes

* Don't use `cls` in a switch
* Hold control to deploy multiple
* Make sure to power on a switch
* Enter simulation mode: click "simulation" in bottom right
* Simulation filters: click "show all/none", then "Edit Filters"
* Setting default gateway in PC: Config -> Global -> Gateway/DNS IPv4
* Setting IP and subnet for an interface of a multilayer switch: Config -> Interface/FastEthernet0/X -> IP Configuration
* Switch & router settings (click save NVRAM to avoid depression!!)
* For sniffers, you might have to connect a hub/switch using crossover cable, whereas it doesn't seem to matter for routers......
* _**There's a button to send ping requests in the GUI!!!!**_ It's the little one in the toolbar that looks like an envelope
* Connecting a router involved setting a "network ip" for each interface, wether it was going to a switch, or end device
* Sometimes pings will work first in a simulation mode (This program is awful)
* If one router is using static, then you have to add static routes to the other devices using RIP&#x20;
