title: "Moving this site to Docusaurus"

# Jekyll was great.
It was. But, I think that in the long run, Docusaurus will be better.

For starters, being able to use `.mdx` rather than normal markdown is, frankly, awesome.

Also, it's waaaay more friendly to the idea of just,,, tossing markdown files in a folder, running a script, and calling it a day.

I know I said this when I moved to Jekyll, but hopefully this time, I actually mean it when I say I'll write more stuff on here.

Also, I'm going to probably move all the stuff from my gitbook on to here, and have a much better system for class notes.
