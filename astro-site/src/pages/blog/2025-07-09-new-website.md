# Moving This Site to Astro
## Also, hey, I have a blog!!

Hi there. It's been... well,,,, an embarassingly long time since I wrote anything on my blog here.

Whoops. Sorry about that.

Safe to say, I've been doing a lot of other projects lately.

Also, if you notice anything I missed in porting my years of content from Docusaurus to this WIP Astro setup, please do reach out to me.

I know I must've missed some stuff, but I'm so crosseyed from getting CSS and images to work correctly that I've lost the will to keep proofreading tbh.
