# Lab 2-2

## Part 1

VMWare default gateway: `192.168.3.250`

### Wireshark from pinging default gateway

I believe the VM's MAC is `00:0c:29:63:2e:72` The default gateway, then, should be `ec:13:db:c8:8e:81`

## Part 2

The IP that responded for `timeslive.co.za` was `216.239.34.21` ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12242178/189410029-384c1f8f-60cd-4c7d-bbd0-aa42a4d6a9d9.png)\
The MAC address that responded and sent-from appear to be the same as before ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12242178/189410336-17ddd763-6820-43e8-a48c-5f13c71e1211.png)
