# Lab 2-2

## Part 1

VMWare default gateway: `192.168.3.250`

### Wireshark from pinging default gateway

I believe the VM's MAC is `00:0c:29:63:2e:72` The default gateway, then, should be `ec:13:db:c8:8e:81`

## Part 2

The IP that responded for `timeslive.co.za` was `216.239.34.21` ![image](/images/github_cdn_4fcf00a3.png)\
The MAC address that responded and sent-from appear to be the same as before ![image](/images/github_cdn_3bbfc6d2.png)
