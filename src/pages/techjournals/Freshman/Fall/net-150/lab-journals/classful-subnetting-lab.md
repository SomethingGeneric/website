# Classful Subnetting Lab

* Make sure to save NVRAM so routers keep working if you restart them
* Keep your sheet with subnet info open!
* Don't forget to check serial clock speed and that the ports are up
* You need routes both way for static routing (if you go that route)
* Use Desktop/IP Config for the end PC's so they don't erase themselves if you forget to save
