# Data Types & Representation Notes

* Different file-types have their own structure to a file's metadata, if any.
* `.txt` files seem to contain little-to-no metadata, and only the content in whatever character encoding. (Maybe it's plain `ASCII`?)
* `.pdf` files seem to carry all the metadata, like fonts, size, and images so that the document would be fully identical even if viewed on a different machine with a different program
