# Linux (and Unix!) Stuff

(Also take a look at my homelab docs (which I really need to update....))

I was ~~I'm a~~ founding core team member and repository maintainer for [Crystal Linux](https://getcryst.al)

I use Arch ~~Crystal~~ on my laptop and desktop machines.

I mostly run Debian (or Proxmox (amped up debian)) on my servers. (Except that this web server is FreeBSD!!!)

There's plenty of Linux/Arch ~~/Crystal~~ stuff on my GitHub!
