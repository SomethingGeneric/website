# TrueNAS System
Motherboard of an old Champlain College lab PC, that I rebuilt into a Rosewill 3U case from NewEgg.

It's got an i7-5820k (that I have NOT overclocked), and 64 GB of DDR4, so way more than I need for NFS storage used mainly by Proxmox.

Unfortunately since I didn't get the Rosewill 4U case, I can't fit a full-size GPU in it, which would be nice for media server activities.

(And because this i7 has no onboard graphics, so I _need_ to put a GPU in it if it were to ever fail to reboot. :/)
