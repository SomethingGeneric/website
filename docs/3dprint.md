# 3D Printing Services

I offer custom 3d printing services. I am not super CAD familiar, so I'd prefer if you find existing designs or make your own, though I am able to help with basic design changes & requests as needed.

## Current Capabilities
* Bambu P1 w/ AMS - 256 mm^3 - PLA, PETG, TPU, ABS/ASA?
* Makerbot Replicator Mini - 100mm x 100mm x 125mm build volume - PLA

## Materials
Currently, I only have PLA on hand. I'm happy to split the cost of acquiring PETG or any CF filament if it's more appropriate for your project.

## PLA Colors Available:
* White
* Black
* Purple
* Orange
* Red (**note**: not usable for plate frames)

## How to order
Please email me at `matt[at]xhec[dot]dev` or contact me on Discord, or (three-zero-one)-nine-seven-four-five-nine-nine-zero to discuss your project, materials, etc.
