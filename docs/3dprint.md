# 3D Printing Services

I offer custom 3d printing services. I am not super CAD familiar, so I'd prefer if you find existing designs or make your own, though I am able to help with basic design changes & requests as needed.

## Current Capabilities
* Prusa MK4 - 250mm x 210mm x 220mm build volume - PLA, PETG, ABS(?)
* FlashForge Finder - 140mm^3 build volume - PLA, PETG(?), ABS(?)
* Makerbot Replicator Mini - 100mm x 100mm x 125mm build volume - PLA

## Materials
Currently, I only have PLA on hand. I'm happy to split the cost of acquiring PETG if it's more appropriate for your project.
Theoretically the MK4 can print many other things, though it may require extruder parts and other upgrades, but that doesn't mean I'll say no.

## How to order
Please email me at `matt[at]xhec[dot]dev` or contact me on Discord, or (three-zero-one)-nine-seven-four-five-nine-nine-zero to discuss your project, materials, etc.
